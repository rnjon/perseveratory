Dear [Names / Leadership Team],

I am writing to formally request a temporary accommodation regarding my unit assignment.

During my most recent shift, a patient repeatedly requested me by name and declined care or assistance from other appropriate staff, including the nursing supervisor, insisting that interactions occur exclusively with me. Despite redirection and reassurance, this pattern persisted.

Given the nature and persistence of these interactions, I believe it is clinically and ethically appropriate to step back from direct involvement with this patient. Continuing to work on the same unit presents a conflict of interest and raises boundary concerns that could compromise therapeutic neutrality, patient care, and staff safety. While I remain fully capable of performing my duties, I feel uncomfortable continuing on the unit under these circumstances.

In the interest of maintaining professional boundaries, minimizing risk, and supporting a healthy treatment environment for all involved, I am requesting to float or be reassigned away from the unit while this patient remains present.

This request is made proactively and in good faith, with the goal of protecting the patient, the team, and myself, and aligning with best practices around boundaries and role clarity. I am, of course, open to discussion and guidance on next steps.

Thank you for your understanding and support. Please let me know if you need any additional information from me.

Kind regards,
Jon
