Chief Complaint

“I’ve been hearing things. I feel like there’s a chip in my head.”

⸻

History of Present Illness

Mr. Hayes is a 34-year-old man with a known psychiatric history and alcohol use disorder who presented to Holy Family with worsening psychotic symptoms and suicidal thoughts after being expelled from a sober home for “a bad attitude.” Over the past several days he has reported auditory perceptual disturbances, describing “white noise” and “voices telling me to kill myself.” He also endorses a somatic belief that “there is a chip in my head.” He reports these symptoms have occurred intermittently in the past.

He has a history of prior psychiatric hospitalizations and prior treatment trials including Haldol, lithium, and olanzapine, but he is currently not taking any psychiatric medications. He denies alcohol use in the past five days and denies recent drug use. ED clinicians documented that he did not appear clinically intoxicated.

In the ED, he endorsed suicidal ideation in the context of hallucinations but did not report a specific plan. He was medically evaluated, cleared, and placed on a Section 12b for transfer to inpatient psychiatry for safety and stabilization.

Upon arrival to the unit, the patient settled well into the milieu, remained cooperative with intake procedures, exhibited no unsafe or disruptive behaviors, and stated he feels safe in the hospital. He continues to report hearing voices but denies current intent to harm himself while on the unit. He is amenable to continued evaluation and treatment.

Assessment

Mr. Hayes presents with an acute exacerbation of psychosis characterized by auditory hallucinations, suicidal ideation, and delusional beliefs. Symptoms appear to be occurring outside of substance intoxication or withdrawal, although alcohol use disorder remains a significant risk factor. He has been medication non-adherent for an extended period, increasing his vulnerability to destabilization.

Given the presence of hallucinations commanding or encouraging self-harm, impaired insight, and limited social supports following displacement from his sober home, the patient meets criteria for involuntary psychiatric hospitalization under Section 12b.

He is currently cooperative, feels safe in the hospital, and shows no behavioral dysregulation. However, he remains at elevated risk due to ongoing psychotic symptoms and the recent suicidal ideation.

⸻

Diagnoses

Primary:
	•	Psychotic disorder, unspecified (rule out schizophrenia spectrum disorder)

Secondary:
	•	Alcohol use disorder, moderate–severe
	•	Medication non-adherence
	•	Psychosocial stressors: unstable housing, limited support system

⸻

Plan

1. Safety
	•	Continue Section 12b
	•	Maintain q15-minute safety checks
	•	Monitor for suicidal ideation, perceptual disturbances, agitation
	•	Maintain a low-stimulus environment as needed

2. Psychiatric Treatment
	•	Initiate antipsychotic medication after diagnostic clarification and discussion with the patient (e.g., restart olanzapine or consider alternative based on prior response)
	•	Evaluate need for mood stabilizer (e.g., lithium) given history
	•	PRN medications for agitation, anxiety, or insomnia per facility protocol

3. Substance Use
	•	CIWA monitoring not indicated at present but continue observation for withdrawal symptoms
	•	Encourage engagement with recovery supports after stabilization

4. Medical
	•	No acute medical issues identified
	•	Routine labs as indicated

5. Psychosocial
	•	Coordinate with social work regarding housing instability and sober-home displacement
	•	Begin exploration of aftercare planning
	•	Encourage engagement in unit activities to promote stabilization

⸻

Disposition

Patient will remain hospitalized on an involuntary basis for safety, further diagnostic clarification, medication initiation, and stabilization of psychotic symptoms. Discharge planning will proceed when clinically appropriate.
