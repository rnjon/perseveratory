Here’s a plain-language explanation, built to be understandable even if someone has never heard these words before.

Neurodiversity — the big idea

Neurodiversity means that human brains come in many natural varieties.

Just like people have different heights, skin tones, personalities, and talents, people also have different ways their brains work.
Neurodiversity is the idea that these differences are normal and part of being human, not automatically problems to be fixed.

Some brains are very good at:
	•	noticing details
	•	remembering facts
	•	focusing deeply
	•	sensing patterns
	•	thinking creatively or logically

Other brains are better at:
	•	reading social cues
	•	multitasking
	•	adapting quickly to change
	•	managing emotions in busy environments

Neither kind is “better.” They’re just different operating systems.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) — one type of neurodivergence

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one way a brain can be different.

People with autism tend to:
	•	experience the world more intensely (sounds, lights, textures, emotions)
	•	process information more literally or logically
	•	communicate or socialize differently, not incorrectly
	•	prefer routines or predictability
	•	have deep interests they care about a lot

It’s called a spectrum because:
	•	no two autistic people are the same
	•	some need a lot of support, some very little
	•	strengths and challenges vary widely

Think of it less like a single condition and more like a range of experiences.

A helpful analogy

Imagine everyone’s brain is a radio receiver.
	•	Some radios are tuned for social signals
	•	Some are tuned for sensory input
	•	Some pick up patterns, numbers, or systems
	•	Some get overwhelmed when too many stations come in at once

Autistic brains often receive more signals at the same time and process them very honestly, without filtering or smoothing them over.

That can be:
	•	exhausting in loud or chaotic places
	•	amazing for focus, honesty, creativity, or precision

⸻

What autism is not

Autism is not:
	•	a lack of intelligence
	•	a lack of empathy
	•	a moral failing
	•	caused by bad parenting
	•	something that looks the same in everyone

Many autistic people feel emotions very deeply — they just may express them differently.

Why people struggle sometimes

The world is mostly designed for non-autistic brains:
	•	lots of noise
	•	unclear social rules
	•	sudden changes
	•	pressure to “act normal”

When an autistic person struggles, it’s often because the environment isn’t accommodating, not because the person is broken.

This is similar to how a wheelchair user struggles in a building with stairs — the problem isn’t the person, it’s the design.

The heart of the idea

Neurodiversity says:

“Different brains are part of human diversity.
Support people where they struggle,
value them where they shine,
and don’t confuse difference with defect.”

Or, in a quieter, Mary-Oliver-kind-of way:

Pay attention.
The world is wider than one way of thinking.
Let people be who they are,
and help them belong.

If you want, I can also:
	•	explain autism to kids
	•	explain it to skeptical adults
	•	explain how it shows up in daily life
	•	explain common myths vs reality

Just tell me the audience.
