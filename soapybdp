S – Subjective:
Patient verbalized distress and frustration earlier in shift, stating, “They should just put me back on the 1:1,” to a peer (witnessed by RN). Patient also made multiple childlike and bizarre statements, indicating emotional regression. Patient verbalized, “I don’t want to sleep.”

O – Objective:
Patient engaged in nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior (NSSIB) via head banging. Safety and coping tools were attempted without sufficient effect. PRN medications administered prior to restraint were ineffective. Patient subsequently received IM Thorazine 200 mg and IM Benadryl 100 mg one-time stat per restraint order. Post-injection, patient continued to exhibit childlike affect and disorganized statements but no further head-banging observed. At 0230, patient received additional Thorazine 200 mg PO and Benadryl 50 mg PO (PRN) for agitation and insomnia. Following medication administration, patient noted to be resting in bed with eyes closed, respirations even and unlabored. Fifteen-minute safety observation rounds maintained.

A – Assessment:
Acute behavioral dysregulation with self-injurious behavior in context of poor impulse control and emotional instability. Limited response to verbal de-escalation and coping interventions, partial response to pharmacologic intervention. Currently stable, sedated, and resting safely.

P – Plan:
	•	Continue 15-minute safety observation rounds.
	•	Monitor for recurrence of self-injurious behaviors or agitation.
	•	Evaluate need for reinstatement of 1:1 observation based on ongoing safety assessment.
	•	Continue medication monitoring for side effects and effectiveness.
	•	Encourage use of coping skills and staff support upon awakening.
	•	Communicate update to treatment team during morning rounds.
