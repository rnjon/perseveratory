From a nurse, on hope

Before I say anything else,
I want you to know this:

I have learned—slowly, humbly—
that it is possible to survive without inspiration.
That there are seasons when courage is not required,
only continuation.
Only staying.

I wish someone had told me that sooner.
That meaning often returns quietly,
not when summoned,
but when we stop demanding it—
the way morning mist lifts from a field
without being chased away.

I wish someone had said:
You are still worthy of care, even now.
Especially now.

So if I am speaking to you as a nurse,
I would not begin with advice.
I would begin by sitting down.

I have sat beside many people
who believed they were empty of hope.
What I have learned is this:
when someone says I cannot go on,
they are rarely asking to disappear.
They are asking—sometimes without words—
to stop carrying so much alone.

Look at the plants outside after frost.
They do not fight the cold.
They draw inward.
They conserve what is essential.
Nothing green scolds itself for going dormant.

You are allowed to do the same.

You are not weak because you are tired.
You are not broken because the light feels far away.
Even the soil rests between seasons,
holding life invisibly, patiently,
without needing to prove anything.

I would tell you:
hope is not a command,
and it is not something I expect you to produce on demand.
Hope can be very small.
Sometimes it is no more than staying where you are.
Sometimes it is allowing someone else
to believe in tomorrow on your behalf.

I have watched people who felt finished
begin again—not dramatically,
but the way daylight arrives:
first a soft thinning of the dark,
then a color you almost miss if you blink.

If you cannot imagine a future,
do not force yourself to.
Just notice this moment.

Your breath is still finding you.
Your body—remarkably—keeps choosing life,
cell by cell, without asking for permission.
Your presence still matters to the living world
that made room for you.

Nothing in nature lives alone.
Roots tangle beneath the surface.
Forests share nourishment quietly,
without keeping score.

And if today all you can do is endure,
that is enough.
Endurance is not failure.
It is a form of care.

Rest here.
Let others hold the light for a while.
The earth is patient.
So are we.
