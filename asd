Behavior Support Plan (BSP)

For an Autistic Adult With Limited-Verbal Communication and High Arousal Behaviors

⸻

1. Overview and Guiding Values

This plan rests on supports that protect autonomy and emotional safety:
	•	Behaviors are communication, not willful misconduct.
	•	Use the least restrictive interventions; prioritize skill-building over suppression.
	•	Provide predictable structure while allowing space for self-expression.
	•	Approach with warmth, curiosity, and respect for sensory differences.

⸻

2. Target Behaviors

Primary Behaviors of Concern
	1.	Kicking or hitting furniture.
	2.	Kicking, hitting, or grabbing caregivers.
	3.	Excited exclamations such as “call 911!” which may escalate arousal in self or peers.

Severity Considerations
	•	Potential for injury to self or others.
	•	High arousal behaviors often linked to unmet needs, sensory overload, or difficulty communicating.

⸻

3. Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA) – Working Hypotheses

Without a completed ABC analysis, these are probable functions that commonly apply in similar ASD presentations:

A. Communication / Expression of Arousal
	•	The “call 911!” statement may be an excitement script, a form of echolalia linked to heightened arousal rather than literal intent.

B. Sensory Regulation
	•	Kicking/hitting may provide proprioceptive input, grounding, or tension release.

C. Escape / Avoidance
	•	Behavior may appear when demands feel too hard, unexpected, or fast.

D. Attention or Social Engagement
	•	The behavior reliably gains high-energy reactions from adults.

E. Reinforcement Through Predictable Responses
	•	If caregivers consistently respond with urgency, redirection, or physical positioning, this may inadvertently reinforce the sequence.

⸻

4. Early Warning Signs / Precursors

Staff should be trained to identify phase-shift cues:
	•	Increased pacing or fidgeting
	•	Louder vocalizations or repeating specific scripts
	•	Rigid body posture
	•	Rapid switching between activities
	•	Facial flushing or widening eyes
	•	Grabbing preferred objects more tightly

Intervening early prevents escalation and preserves dignity.

5. Preventive Strategies (Proactive Supports)

A. Sensory Regulation

Provide scheduled, structured sensory input:
	•	Heavy-work activities (carrying soft weighted items, pushing laundry cart, chair pulls).
	•	Access to a safe kicking object (e.g., foam pad, therapy ball) designated for releasing energy.
	•	Noise-reducing headphones available at all times.

B. Predictable Schedule + Visual Supports
	•	A visual daily schedule with clear transitions.
	•	Use “first–then” language: “First brush teeth, then drawing time.”

C. Co-Regulation and Calming Presence
	•	Calm, slow verbal cadence.
	•	Grounding choices: “Do you want squeeze ball or rocking chair?”

D. Communication Supports
	•	Provide alternatives for excitement or distress:
	•	Communication cards: “I’m excited,” “I need help,” “I don’t like this,” “Break please.”
	•	If verbal, script a safe excitement phrase (e.g., “Wow!” or “So cool!”) to replace “call 911!”

E. Clear, Neutral Boundaries
	•	Pre-teach: “We keep hands and feet safe. Kicking goes to the pad.”
	•	Practice during calm times.

6. Intervention During Escalation

A. Use Minimal Language

Short, predictable phrases:
	•	“You’re safe.”
	•	“Feet stay down.”
	•	“Let’s go to your calm spot.”

B. Support Regulation
	•	Offer weighted lap pad, rocking chair, or quiet sensory corner.
	•	Dim lights, decrease audience, reduce demands.

C. Redirect Energy Safely
	•	Guide toward appropriate movement outlets:
	•	Kicking the padded mat
	•	Squeezing a soft object
	•	Throwing soft balls into a basket

D. Address “Call 911!” Statements

Avoid dramatic reactions.
Use calm reframing:
	•	“You’re excited. Let’s say ‘Wow!’ instead.”
	•	If overstimulation is suspected, shift to grounding (“smell the flower, blow the candle”).

E. Safety Protocol

If he targets staff:
	•	Step back, angle body at 45°, palms open and visible.
	•	Use non-contact blocking techniques trained by the agency (e.g., CPI, MAPA, PMT—whatever is standard).
	•	Remove additional stimuli.

7. Post-Incident Supports

A. Once Regulated
	•	Offer reassurance: “You’re okay. Let’s rest.”
	•	Provide access to preferred calming activity (drawing, music).

B. Gentle Debrief (adapted for limited verbal communication)

Keep it simple:
	•	“Something felt too big.”
	•	“Next time, you can say: ‘Help please’ or ‘Break.’”
	•	Use visuals to walk through the event if helpful.

C. Staff Reflection
	•	What preceded the escalation?
	•	Did we miss an early cue?
	•	What worked well to support him?

⸻

8. Skill Development Goals

A. Communication Skills
	•	Teach a substitute phrase for excitement (“Excited!” or “Wow!”).
	•	Teach a break request.
	•	Teach basic emotion identification using visuals.

B. Self-Regulation Skills
	•	Introduce consistent routines: breathing, sensory breaks, safe movement.
	•	Practice during calm moments, not during crisis.

C. Social Understanding
	•	Social stories explaining:
	•	When emergency services are used
	•	Keeping hands and feet safe
	•	Safe excitement expressions

D. Executive Function Support
	•	Support transitions using countdowns (e.g., “2 minutes, then all done”).

⸻

9. Environmental Modifications
	•	Remove or pad objects that are commonly kicked during escalation.
	•	Ensure ample space for pacing or movement.
	•	Have a designated low-stimulus retreat area.

⸻

10. Caregiver Training Components

All caregivers should be trained in:
	•	Understanding ASD communication differences
	•	Sensory needs and proactive tools
	•	Non-coercive, non-confrontational approaches
	•	De-escalation techniques
	•	Consistency across staff to avoid accidental reinforcement
	•	Maintaining a calm affect even under stress

⸻

11. Data Collection and Review

Track daily:
	•	Antecedent conditions
	•	What early signs appeared
	•	What interventions helped
	•	Duration and intensity of behavior
	•	What skills were used successfullye
